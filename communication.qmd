## Slack

Slack is the primary lab communication space as it allows the entire lab and affiliated researchers to share information.
However, note that at the time of this writing, we use the free version of Slack, which does not preserve messages beyond 90 days.

Slack best practices:

-   Include tags where appropriate to draw attention to the relevant people.
-   Reply to individual posts as a thread so it is clear what the response goes to.
-   Post to public channels so all can weigh in and see the answers (others probably have the same question!).
-   Don't be shy about frequent posting or sharing interesting things - more regular sharing helps build community!

## Email

Email is the preferred communication method for official business (e.g., communicating about funding, degrees, time off, etc.) because it can be referred back to beyond the 90-day limit of Slack.
Additionally, email is preferred for communication about projects and papers with external collaborators.

A few tips for email best practices:

-   Include a descriptive subject line (this makes searching easier in the future).
-   Keep each email focused on one specific subject - this helps avoid email threads from containing multiple separate conversations, which can become confusing and difficult to search for in the future.
-   Include hyperlinks wherever relevant/possible (especially to docs you want feedback on). This makes it easier for the recipients to access the information.
-   Be clear about any action items. Lists are often helpful.
-   Include deadlines. While the deadlines need to be reasonable, it is important so your busy collaborators can build your request into their workflow.
-   Include your name at the end of the message so it is clear where the message ends.

## Google drive
We maintain a lab Google drive for sharing internal documents, including drafts of papers. While students may use the platform of their choice for writing, Google docs generally remain the easiest for a range of collaborators to engage with, particularly if you anticipate receiving feedback from multiple individuals simultaneously (merging divergent drafts is no fun!). Just be sure to set the sharing settings so that anyone with a link can edit, as long as there is not sensitive information, as this ensures that your collaborators will definitely have access to your doc when they need it.

## Lab meetings

Once the lab is a sufficient size, we will hold regular lab meetings.
We will set the schedule for lab meetings at the beginning of each quarter.
Lab meetings will consist of a combination of paper discussions, professional development discussions, lab projects, and team member papers/presentations with feedback. The exact mix will depend on lab needs and interests.
