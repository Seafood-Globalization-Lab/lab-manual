# Students


Starting graduate school or joining a research lab as an undergraduate can feel overwhelming, but you're not alone in this journey.
This section provides practical guidance to help you navigate your first quarter and beyond, both academically and personally.

## Course Registration and Credit Planning

### Credit Requirements and Funding

You need to register for a minimum of 10 credits per quarter to receive funding as a graduate student each quarter.

### Research vs. Coursework Balance

Most graduate students typically devote half of your credits to research thesis with the other half being towards classes.
However, many students choose to take fewer research credits in their first year or two to focus on completing required coursework early.
This front-loading approach allows you to concentrate more fully on research in later years when you're deeper into your thesis work.

A typical approach might look like:

-   **Early quarters**: More coursework credits, fewer research credits
-   **Later quarters**: More research credits as you advance in your thesis

Work with your advisor to plan a credit distribution that makes sense for your specific program requirements and research timeline.

### Course Selection

Be sure to review the [SAFS Forms, Guidelines & Handbooks](https://fish.uw.edu/students/advising/forms-guidelines-handbooks/) for specific degree requirements and recommended course sequences.

Don't hesitate to reach out to older students in the lab or department for their perspectives on courses - they can provide valuable insights about workload, professors, and which classes are most relevant to your research interests.

## Adjusting to Seattle

### Housing and Neighborhoods

Seattle offers diverse neighborhoods, each with its own character.
Many graduate students live in areas like the U-District (close to campus), Fremont, Ballard, or Capitol Hill.

### Transportation

The UW provides students with an unlimited bus pass (UPASS card) included in your fees.
If you're driving, be aware that parking on campus can be expensive and limited.

### Exploring the City

Seattle has a vibrant social and cultural scene.
There are many places to meet people, including the Little Red Hen which hosts free line dancing classes.
The city also offers hiking trails, museums, farmers markets, and a diverse foods to try.

## Building Community and Social Connections

### University Resources

Take advantage of student organizations and clubs related to your interests - both academic and recreational.
The UW has hundreds of student groups covering everything from professional development to hobbies.

### Online Communities

Facebook groups can be valuable for meeting people and staying informed about local events.
Look for groups specific to graduate students, your department, or your neighborhood.

### Lab Community

Don't underestimate the importance of building relationships within the lab and department.
Attend social events, grab coffee with labmates, and participate in departmental activities when possible.

## Mental Health and Wellbeing

Graduate school and research can be mentally challenging.
The University of Washington provides several resources to support student mental health:

-   **Counseling Center**: Offers individual and group counseling services
-   **Crisis Line**: Available 24/7 for immediate support
-   **Wellness resources**: Including stress management workshops and mindfulness programs

Don't hesitate to use these resources - taking care of your mental health is just as important as your academic progress.
Many successful graduate students have benefited from counseling or other support services during their studies.

## Getting Started Checklist

In your first few weeks, consider:

-   Meeting with your advisor to discuss course planning and research expectations
-   Connecting with other lab members and graduate students in the department
-   Exploring campus resources (library, student services, recreational facilities)
-   Setting up your workspace
-   Getting your Husky Card and lab keys
-   Joining relevant mailing lists and online groups
-   Familiarizing yourself with Seattle's transit system
-   Finding local essentials (grocery stores, healthcare, etc.)

Everyone adjusts at their own pace.
Be patient with yourself as you navigate this new environment, and don't hesitate to ask questions - your labmates and advisor are here to help you succeed.
