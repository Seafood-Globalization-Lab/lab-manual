This makes it easier for the recipients to access the information.\nBe clear about any action items. Lists are often helpful.\nInclude deadlines. While the deadlines need to be reasonable, it is important so your busy collaborators can build your request into their workflow.\nInclude your name at the end of the message so it is clear where the message ends.\nReply to emails you receive in a timely fashion, even if only to say you need a bit longer to provide a full response.\nSet an out of office message if you will be away or checking email less frequently than usual with a date you will return so recipients know when to expect a response by (and therefore, when to follow up, if needed).",

These should be specific questions or issues that are best resolved through an in person discussion. These are often related to conceptual issues, generating ideas, and sketching out solutions rather. You can of course include quick questions, but these can often be answered outside of the meeting via Slack (i.e., you don’t need to wait until a weekly meeting to have them answered).\nAction items - these will likely emerge from the meeting, but it is good to include points here that you already know of because we can then review those along with any action items/next steps that emerged from the discussion to prioritize them.\n\n\nRegardless of whether your meeting is within the lab or not, a bit of preparation ahead of the meeting will ensure it is productive.

    "text": "Recommended workflow\nThe typical lab workflow aims to produce open data and reproducible analysis. This lab typically uses R/RStudio and GitHub.\nSteps: each of these should be contained in separate code (e.g., separate “.R” files, code chunks, or folders):\n\nCreate a version-controlled R project repository within the Seafood Globalization Lab GitHub organization. If a GitHub repository already exists, pull this onto your local and work from within it.\n\nEach project folder, whether created by you or pulled from GitHub, should include the following folders:\n\ndata - Keep all raw data in this folder and do not modify the raw data\noutput - Write out all cleaned versions of data (make sure the file name differs from the raw data file name to avoid overwriting and confusion) and analysis output here\nfigures - Write out all figures here. You may initially want to use descriptive figure names, but ultimately will want to name the files according to the figure numbering in the resulting manuscript (e.g., fig1.png)\nscripts or R - Save all R scripts here. If the project will be set up as an R package, then the folder must be named “R”.\n\nCreate other folders as needed (e.g., “literature”, “ms”, “archive”, etc.) but add the folder to your .gitignore file so they are not pushed up to GitHub.\nYou may want to add dates to files that will have multiple versions (e.g., different runs of an analysis, versions of figures, etc.) using the format YYYY-MM-DD to the beginning of file names so files are sorted accordingly.\n\nREADME - A text README file should be created for every project and a full description of the raw data should be included here\nData Cleaning - do NOT edit the raw data file, instead do ALL cleaning within your code. The R janitor package is useful for cleaning your data frame. Additional useful R functions include to_lower(), case_when(), str_extract, and separate(). See X for more.\n\nYour final clean data file(s) should be in a tidy (“long”) format. See Wickham for more on tidy format.\n\nCommenting - There is no such thing as too much commenting and documentation. All code should be extensively commented such that each step of the analysis is clear to any reader without that individual knowing R. Aim for a commented section header for each code chunk along with one comment per line of code. Follow the style guide [FIXIT: add link to style page] for additional notes on commenting code Data\nPlotting and validation - We recommend producing simple scatter plots, boxplots, check that outliers are not errors.\nSaving the cleaned data file - After data cleaning and plotting/validation, output data into its final, clean format (write this file to the “Output” folder. Everyone in the research team should start from the same cleaned dataset. They should also have access to to code that produced the cleaned file so they can refer back to all cleaning steps.\nData Analysis - Create separate scripts to process, filter, aggregate, summarize data as needed for different types of analyses.\nGitHub\n\nMake sure you are on the correct branch.\nPull all changes before beginning work on your code\nAll code changes should be pushed to GitHub on a regular basis (it is better to commit more rather than less)\nAim to include as descriptive commit messages as possible\nIn general, do not push the “data,” “output,” or “figures” folders up to GitHub (i.e., include these folders in your .gitignore file) because they are often too large\nDo not push up non-analysis folders (e.g., “literature”, “ms”, “archive” etc.). Instead add to .gitignore\nWhen setting up a GitHub project, default to private settings. If a project is made public, carefully check for any data that may have been pushed up to ensure it is okay for this to be public",

    "text": "Writing tips\nTo help with your writing, here are a few tips based on some of my most common comments:\n\nStart by writing out a specific statement of the focus of your paper. This does not have to be the main finding, but instead is often a statement of the key gap or motivation along with the focal question(s).\nTake your focal statement and backwards plan the main points that lead up to that statement. What is the series of points that will naturally lead the reader to conclude that your focus is needed and important?\nEach point should form a topic sentence. Those topic sentences must be supported by specific evidence from peer reviewed literature.\nSupportive evidence should consist of specific findings and examples drawn. The key here is to “show” rather than “tell” the reader. For example, rather than saying “Researchers have found aquaculture to be important to seafood supplies (Smith et al. 2022),” say something like “Aquaculture supplies half of all seafood globally (Smith et al. 2022).”\nAvoid using direct quotes. It is unlikely that the way the original author phrased a point is the best way to make that point within your paper. Thinking about the main point and rephrasing it to fit within your argument will likely improve the flow.\nUse figures and tables as supporting evidence, but do not just walk through the figures and tables. Do not say “Figure 1 shows X is true” or “As shown in Figure 1, X is true.” Instead say “X is true (Figure 1).” A good test is to look for any instances where you refer to a figure or table outside of parentheses.\nBe concise and direct. Every time you read your writing try to cut out words.\nUse first person and active language. This means rather than saying “The data was collected by…” you should say “We collected the data by…”\n\nAs you work on your writing, know that most people find it difficult and feeling frustrated is common. If you are feeling stuck, try taking a step back and re-mapping your core argument. Sometimes the best thing is just to start putting words on the paper, knowing that it won’t be any good the first pass.\nAdditionally, here are a few resources you can review for more information:\nTen Simple (Empirical) Rules for Writing Science\nSimple rules for concise scientific writing\nWriting Science: How to Write Papers That Get Cited and Proposals That Get Funded - Jessica also has a copy to borrow.",
